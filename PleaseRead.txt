You can import the Package to run the project, Althouhgh it is highly recommended to access through the GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Yeeway69/GameAI_FinalProject

Things to Notice: (also reason for recommendation above)

Some feature may request Unity 6, therefore please run with the current Official Recommended Unity 6 Version to Run the Project

To see the Project, Go to the Scenes Folder, the scene that contains the Final Project is called "Final Project" Scene.

To get the best visual it is recommended to click on the Adaptive Probe Volume GameObject in the hierarchy, it will have a warning that guides you to enable Adaptive Probe Volume in your Project, since settings can not be exported as Packages.

Finally, the Weather Module asset I used is in a package Manifest mode, Unity does not officially allow you to export that, therefore we don't bother with that, the project should run without it however with some major visual downgrades.
